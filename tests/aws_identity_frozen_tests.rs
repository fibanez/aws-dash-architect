//! AWS Identity Management Frozen Tests
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive frozen testing for AWS identity structures
//! that ensure data compatibility and prevent breaking changes to user authentication data.
//! Each test verifies that critical AWS identity data structures maintain their exact
//! serialization format across application updates.
//!
//! # Why These Tests Matter
//!
//! Users rely on stable authentication data formats for seamless access to their AWS resources.
//! Any unintended changes to how credentials, accounts, or identity center configurations
//! are stored could result in users losing access to their AWS environments or requiring
//! manual reconfiguration of their authentication setup.
//!
//! # Snapshot Testing Methodology
//!
//! This module uses `insta` snapshot testing to capture the exact JSON serialization
//! format of AWS identity structures. When these tests run:
//! 1. The current data structure is serialized to JSON
//! 2. The result is compared against a stored "golden" snapshot
//! 3. Any differences trigger a test failure, alerting developers to data format changes
//! 4. Developers can review changes and update snapshots only when intentional
//!
//! # Data Structures Tested
//!
//! - **AwsCredentials**: Temporary and long-term AWS authentication credentials
//! - **AwsAccount**: AWS account information and role configurations
//! - **AwsIdentityCenter**: AWS SSO and identity center integration settings
//!
//! # Integration with Application
//!
//! These structures are used throughout the application for:
//! - Authenticating AWS API calls for CloudFormation operations
//! - Managing multi-account access and role switching
//! - Storing user authentication preferences and session data
//! - Integrating with AWS Identity Center for enterprise authentication

/// Verifies that AWS credentials maintain their exact serialization format.
///
/// This test ensures that the AwsCredentials structure preserves its JSON format
/// across application updates, preventing users from losing access to their stored
/// authentication data. This matters because users depend on consistent credential
/// storage for seamless AWS API access.
///
/// # What This Test Covers
///
/// - **Complete credential structure**: Access key, secret key, session token, and expiration
/// - **Optional field handling**: Session tokens and expiration dates may be None
/// - **DateTime serialization**: Ensures expiration timestamps maintain consistent format
/// - **Security field preservation**: Critical authentication fields must remain accessible
///
/// # User Impact
///
/// If this test fails, users might experience:
/// - Authentication failures when the application starts
/// - Loss of stored temporary credentials requiring re-authentication
/// - Incompatibility with existing credential storage files
/// - Required manual reconfiguration of AWS access
///
/// # Edge Cases Tested
///
/// - Both temporary credentials (with session token and expiration)
/// - Long-term credentials (access key and secret only)
/// - Proper handling of Optional fields in serialization

/// Verifies that AWS account configuration maintains stable serialization format.
///
/// This test ensures that AwsAccount structures preserve their data format,
/// protecting users' multi-account AWS configurations from being corrupted by
/// application updates. This matters because users often manage complex multi-account
/// setups that would be time-consuming to reconfigure manually.
///
/// # What This Test Covers
///
/// - **Account identification**: Account ID and human-readable name preservation
/// - **Role configuration**: Cross-account role names for access management
/// - **Contact information**: Optional account email for administration
/// - **Credential association**: Optional embedded credentials for account access
///
/// # User Impact
///
/// If this test fails, users might experience:
/// - Loss of saved AWS account configurations
/// - Inability to switch between different AWS accounts
/// - Corruption of role-based access configurations
/// - Required manual re-entry of account details and role names
///
/// # Multi-Account Scenarios Tested
///
/// - Production account with administrative contact email
/// - Role-based cross-account access configuration
/// - Account without embedded credentials (using external auth)
/// - Proper handling of optional fields in complex account setups

/// Verifies that AWS Identity Center API contracts remain stable.
///
/// This test ensures that the AwsIdentityCenter constructor maintains its required
/// parameters and basic functionality, protecting enterprise users who rely on
/// AWS SSO integration for authentication. This matters because enterprise environments
/// often have complex identity management requirements that depend on stable SSO configuration.
///
/// # What This Test Covers
///
/// - **Constructor API stability**: Required parameters for Identity Center setup
/// - **Parameter validation**: Region, start URL, and client ID requirements
/// - **Object creation**: Successful instantiation with valid enterprise configuration
/// - **Memory allocation**: Basic structural integrity of created instances
///
/// # User Impact
///
/// If this test fails, enterprise users might experience:
/// - Inability to configure AWS SSO authentication
/// - Breaking changes in Identity Center integration setup
/// - Loss of single sign-on capabilities for their organization
/// - Required reconfiguration of enterprise authentication workflows
///
/// # Enterprise Authentication Scenarios
///
/// - Standard AWS Identity Center setup with regional configuration
/// - Custom start URL for organization-specific SSO portals
/// - Client ID validation for registered applications
/// - Basic API contract enforcement for enterprise integrations
///
/// # API Contract Testing
///
/// This test uses structural validation rather than snapshot testing because
/// it focuses on API stability rather than serialization format. The memory
/// size check ensures the constructor successfully creates a valid instance.
