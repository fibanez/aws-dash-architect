//! Project Management System Frozen Tests
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive frozen testing for the project management
//! data structures that store user projects, environments, and CloudFormation
//! resources. These tests ensure that users' complex project configurations
//! remain stable and accessible across application updates.
//!
//! # Why Project Data Integrity Matters
//!
//! Users invest significant time organizing their CloudFormation infrastructure
//! into projects with multiple environments, resource configurations, and deployment
//! settings. Project data represents:
//! - Hours of manual configuration and organization work
//! - Critical business infrastructure mapped to specific environments
//! - Complex multi-region and multi-account deployment architectures
//! - Historical resource relationships and dependency mappings
//!
//! # Data Structures Under Test
//!
//! The project management system includes several interconnected data types:
//! - **Project**: Top-level container with metadata, environments, and templates
//! - **Environment**: AWS account and region configurations for deployment contexts
//! - **CloudFormationResource**: Individual AWS resources with properties and metadata
//! - **ResourceNode**: Dependency graph nodes representing resource relationships
//! - **AwsRegion/AwsAccount**: AWS service configuration primitives
//!
//! # Serialization Format Validation
//!
//! Project data is serialized to JSON for:
//! - **Persistent storage**: User projects saved to disk between application sessions
//! - **Data export**: Sharing project configurations between team members
//! - **Backup and restore**: Protecting user investment in project organization
//! - **Version control integration**: Tracking project changes over time
//!
//! Any changes to serialization format could result in:
//! - Loss of user project configurations requiring manual recreation
//! - Incompatibility with team-shared project files
//! - Broken integration with external tools consuming project data
//! - Corruption of resource relationship mappings
//!
//! # Testing Methodology
//!
//! These frozen tests use `insta` snapshot testing to capture exact JSON
//! representations of project data structures. Each test validates:
//! 1. Complete data structure serialization including all fields
//! 2. Proper handling of optional fields and nested relationships
//! 3. Compatibility with complex real-world project configurations
//! 4. Preservation of user-critical metadata and configuration details

/// Verifies that complete Project data structure maintains serialization stability.
///
/// This test ensures that the main Project container preserves its format across
/// application updates, protecting users' comprehensive project configurations
/// from corruption. This matters because users organize complex infrastructure
/// projects with multiple environments, source control integration, and CloudFormation
/// templates that would be time-intensive to recreate.
///
/// # What This Test Covers
///
/// - **Project metadata**: Name, description, creation/update timestamps
/// - **Source integration**: Local folder paths and Git repository URLs
/// - **Environment configurations**: Development, staging, and production setups
/// - **Template integration**: Embedded CloudFormation templates (DAG now computed dynamically)
/// - **Regional defaults**: AWS region preferences for project deployments
///
/// # User Impact
///
/// If this test fails, users might experience:
/// - Loss of entire project configurations requiring complete rebuild
/// - Broken links to local folders and Git repositories
/// - Corruption of environment-specific deployment settings
/// - Invalid CloudFormation template associations
/// - Loss of project organization and metadata
///
/// # Complex Project Scenarios Tested
///
/// - Full project with all optional fields populated
/// - Multi-environment project structure (development environment shown)
/// - Integration with source control systems via Git URL
/// - Local filesystem integration via project folder paths
/// - Complete CloudFormation template embedding (DAG computed on-demand)
/// - Timestamp preservation for project lifecycle tracking
