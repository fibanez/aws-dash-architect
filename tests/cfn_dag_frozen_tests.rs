//! CloudFormation Dependency Graph (DAG) Frozen Tests
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive frozen testing for CloudFormation resource dependency
//! graph structures, ensuring that the core algorithms for dependency resolution and
//! graph validation remain stable across application updates. The DAG system is critical
//! for users to understand and manage complex CloudFormation template dependencies.
//!
//! # Why DAG Testing is Critical
//!
//! CloudFormation templates often contain dozens or hundreds of interconnected resources
//! with complex dependency relationships. Users rely on accurate dependency analysis to:
//! - Understand which resources depend on others before making changes
//! - Identify circular dependencies that would cause deployment failures
//! - Optimize deployment order for faster stack updates
//! - Troubleshoot failed deployments by understanding dependency chains
//!
//! # Dependency Graph Algorithms Tested
//!
//! The ResourceDag structure implements several critical algorithms:
//! - **Topological sorting**: Determines safe deployment order for resources
//! - **Cycle detection**: Identifies circular dependencies that prevent deployment
//! - **Dependency traversal**: Finds all upstream and downstream dependencies
//! - **Graph validation**: Ensures dependency relationships are valid and complete
//!
//! # Snapshot Testing for Graph Structures
//!
//! DAG structures are particularly sensitive to serialization changes because:
//! 1. Graph algorithms depend on specific data structure layouts
//! 2. Node relationships must be preserved exactly for correctness
//! 3. Any changes to internal representation could break dependency analysis
//! 4. Users' saved project files contain serialized DAG data
//!
//! The frozen tests use both `insta` snapshots and golden file comparison to ensure:
//! - Internal DAG structure remains stable across updates
//! - Serialization format compatibility with saved user projects
//! - Algorithm correctness is preserved when data structures change
//!
//! # Integration with CloudFormation Templates
//!
//! The DAG system integrates with CloudFormation template parsing to:
//! - Extract explicit dependencies from DependsOn attributes
//! - Detect implicit dependencies from resource property references
//! - Generate visual dependency graphs for user interface display
//! - Validate template integrity before deployment attempts

/// Verifies that empty ResourceDag initialization maintains stable structure.
///
/// This test ensures that a newly created ResourceDag maintains its baseline
/// data structure format, protecting users from corruption of their CloudFormation
/// dependency analysis. This matters because users depend on consistent DAG
/// representation for accurate visualization and dependency management.
///
/// # What This Test Covers
///
/// - **Empty DAG initialization**: Verifies clean starting state for new graphs
/// - **Internal data structure layout**: Ensures algorithm-critical fields are preserved
/// - **Serialization baseline**: Provides reference format for empty dependency graphs
/// - **Algorithm state validation**: Confirms graph algorithms start with proper initialization
///
/// # User Impact
///
/// If this test fails, users might experience:
/// - Corrupted dependency analysis when opening new CloudFormation templates
/// - Incorrect visual representation of empty templates in the graph view
/// - Algorithm failures when adding the first resources to a template
/// - Incompatibility with existing project files containing DAG data
///
/// # Dependency Algorithm Foundation
///
/// The empty DAG provides the foundation for all dependency operations:
/// - Topological sorting starts from empty state and builds dependency order
/// - Cycle detection algorithms require proper initialization to function correctly
/// - Graph traversal operations depend on consistent node and edge representations
/// - Visual rendering systems expect specific data structure formats

    let dag = ResourceDag::new();

    // Test that DAG structure is frozen
    assert_json_snapshot!("empty_resource_dag", dag);
}

/// Validates ResourceDag format compatibility using golden file comparison.
///
/// This test provides an additional layer of protection for DAG serialization
/// by comparing against a stored golden file, ensuring that CloudFormation
/// dependency graphs maintain exact format compatibility with existing user projects.
/// This matters because users often save complex project files containing DAG data
/// that must remain readable across application versions.
///
/// # What This Test Covers
///
/// - **File format stability**: Ensures saved project files remain compatible
/// - **JSON serialization consistency**: Validates pretty-printed format preservation
/// - **Cross-version compatibility**: Protects against breaking changes in stored data
/// - **Fixture generation**: Automatically creates baseline for new installations
///
/// # User Impact
///
/// If this test fails, users might experience:
/// - Inability to open existing project files containing DAG data
/// - Corruption of saved CloudFormation template analysis
/// - Loss of complex dependency relationships they've analyzed previously
/// - Required re-analysis of large templates they've already processed
///
/// # Golden File Testing Strategy
///
/// This test implements a dual validation approach:
/// 1. **Automatic baseline creation**: Generates golden file on first run
/// 2. **Strict format validation**: Compares JSON structure and formatting
/// 3. **Human-readable storage**: Pretty-printed JSON for manual inspection
/// 4. **Comprehensive coverage**: Tests complete DAG serialization pipeline
///
/// # Integration with User Workflow
///
/// The golden file represents the exact format users see when:
/// - Exporting dependency analysis results to JSON files
/// - Sharing CloudFormation template analysis between team members
/// - Backing up complex dependency configurations
/// - Integrating with external tools that consume DAG data
